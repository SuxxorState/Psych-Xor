Songs have seperated vocals in this engine!
to use this feature, name files accordingly:
Inst- Instrumental
PVoices - Player Vocals
OVoices - Opponent Voices

Alternatively, you can just name the combined vocals PVoices and not put any opponent track at all. however, there are a few bugs that come with this, so be warned!
